    <p>Understanding the local healthcare system helps significantly with discharge planning and providing a more
      holistic care to patients.
    </p>
    <p>It is also part of Code of Conduct by the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency
      (AHPRA)<RefTag>1</RefTag> that
      practitioners need to understand the principles of public health and ensure the services are provided
      appropriately to the patients.
    </p>
    <p>However, informal discussions with current physiotherapy students revealed that the Australian healthcare
      system was not addressed in the university. As a result, international students find it hard to do an
      appropriate discharge planning and get involved in the multidisciplinary team. Their performance in the clinical
      placements, therefore, is hugely impacted by this lack of knowledge.
    </p>
    <p>For example, for a public patient with total hip replacement, he may be discharged from acute setting to an
      inpatient rehab setting with ambulating with 2 wheel frame and assist by 1. However, in the private setting, he
      may need to be ambulating with 2 wheel frame independently in order to be accepted by the inpatient rehab
      services. Different healthcare services have different discharge criteria, thus, it is important to get a good
      understanding of the local healthcare system.

    <h3>Public system</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>The government supports the cost of healthcare under the <ALink
        link="https://www.humanservices.gov.au/individuals/medicare">Medicare system.</ALink>
      </li>
      <li>It also provides extra healthcare benefits to veterans and people with low incomes.</li>
      <li>Relevant information can be found on <ALink
        link="https://www.humanservices.gov.au/individuals/services/medicare/medicare-card">Australian Department of
        Human Services.</ALink>
      </li>
      <li>With Medicare, people are entitled to free treatment as a public patient in a public hospital. It also covers
        part or all of the cost of seeing a GP, a specialist, and some allied health services, such as physiotherapy and
        occupational therapy.
      </li>

    </ul>

    <h3>Private system</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>With a private healthcare system, you will have more choice about your care.</li>
      <li>Waiting time for elective surgery is usually shorter.</li>

        planning.

        <li>Depending on what the PT charges at the clinic, will decide if the patient has to pay out of pocket.</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <p><b>Depends on what level of cover or how much you pay your insure will determine your cost for extra cover or
      hospital cover. For example:</b></p>
    <h4>Extra cover</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Level A Cover = Physio $60 (The private insurance will cover for $60 of your physio session)</li>
      <li>Level B Cover = Physio $40 (The private insurance will cover for $40 of your physio session)</li>
      <li>Level C Cover = Physio $0 (The private insurance will NOT cover for your physio session)</li>
      <li>Apparently, Level A Cover cost more than Level B or C.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Hospital cover</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>To be used at hospital e.g. acute or subacute</li>
      <li>Level A Cover = acute & rehab</li>
      <li>Level B Cover = acute & rehab, but not surgery</li>
      <li>Level C cover = acute but not rehab or surgery</li>
      <li>Apparently, Level A Cover cost more than Level B or C.</li>
